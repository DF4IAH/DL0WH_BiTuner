# DL0WH_BiTuner_Firmware
Based on the DJ0ABR hardware this firmware tries to make some enhancements for DL0WH device inclusion.

DF4IAH: "__When I gave a try for compilation on the current Atmel Studio 7 I have failed to do so. The IDE
has changed a lot, compilation is done with the gcc now. Due to incompatible changes by Atmel /
Microchip Technologies  I have started to modify the code to get the whole thing running again.__

__The initial commit is the code from DJ0ABR with minimal changes for the compilation process to work.
Later on some features will be added to give the DL0WH team the possibility to integrate this tuner(s)
for the club station and around.__"

## Credits
Credits are given to DJ0ABR for his enthusiastic work which is nearly ideal for that what the DL0WH team
was looking for.

## Hardware
The PCB can easily be obtained by this link of DJ0ABR:

## Context of usage
The team of DL0WH has nothing to do with the hardware components. Solely the firmware of the ATmega88
is enhanced or being rewritten later on. This GitHub repository is used for the DL0WH programmers for easy
access. No widespread give off is intended.
